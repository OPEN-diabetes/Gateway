<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The OPEN team invites you and your child to take part in a global study that examines the impact of Do-It-Yourself Artificial Pancreas Systems (DIYAPS) on the health and well-being of users. The following information explains what to expect if you choose on your child's behalf to take part in the research. <b>Please read it carefully. If you do not understand some of the information and/or would like to discuss anything related to the project, feel free to contact a member of our research team.</b></p>
<h1>Name of Study</h1> 
<p>OPEN (Outcomes of Patients’ Evidence with Novel, Do-it-Yourself Artificial Pancreas Technology)</p>
<h1>Name of Principal Investigator</h1>
<p>Dr Shane O’Donnell</p>
<h1>What is this research about?</h1>
<p>A growing number of people living with diabetes are choosing to build DIYAPS to help with the management of their condition. However, more research is needed to understand if and how people living with diabetes benefit from using these systems. This study has three main aims:</p> 
<ol>
    <li>to examine the clinical and quality of life outcomes of DIYAPS users</li>
    <li>to identify potential technical improvements that could be made to artificial pancreas technology of all kinds, and</li>
    <li>to investigate how more people can benefit from the innovations being developed by the DIY community.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Why is OPEN doing this research?</h1>
<p>By carrying out this research study, OPEN will be able to build evidence about the effectiveness of DIYAPS and potential further improvements in the technology that could be introduced in the future.</p>
<h1>Why am I being invited to take part?</h1>
<p>You have been invited to take part because you are the parent/carer of a DIYAPS user.</p>
<h1>What will happen if I decide to take part in this research study?</h1>
<p>If you kindly agree to take part, you will be first given a unique <b>participant ID</b> which will guarantee your anonymity in the survey. The ID allows you to take a break and come back where you have left off at a later stage or login on another device and continue from there. Therefore, <b>please keep it safe</b> by noting it down, emailing it to yourself or taking a picture of it as you may need it later.</p></p> 
<p>You will then be asked to <b>complete a series of questionnaires</b> designed to access the quality of life and well-being of you and your child. Altogether, it should not take you more than 20-30 minutes. These questionnaires will focus on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Demographic information (about yourself and your child)</li>
    <li>Information about your child’s health and diabetes</li>
    <li>Your and your child’s general experiences of living with diabetes</li>
    <li>Your general sense of well-being caring for someone with diabetes</li>
    <li>Your sleep quality and mood</li>
    <li>Your and your child's general experiences of building and maintaining a DIYAPS</li>
</ul>
<p>To further assist our research, we would kindly invite you and your child to <b>become members of</b> a data repository site called ‘Open Humans’. <b>Open Humans</b> allows people to <b>anonymously donate</b> their health related data (including <b>device data</b>, e.g. from their glucose monitoring, or Nightscout, etc.) for research purposes. Once you sign up to Open Humans, we invite you to <b>join our project</b> on the Open Humans platform called the ‘Open Project’. This should take you no longer than 2-3 minutes.</p>
<p>Choosing to sign up to Open Humans and joining the OPEN project on Open Humans is <b>optional</b> and you decide what data you would like to share with us (if at all), and whether you and your child would like to <b>participate in any further follow on studies</b>. Bear in mind that your participation in the OPEN project and future studies will greatly assist us to enhance the existing scientific evidence on DIYAPS.</p>
<p>If you (and your child) are happy to sign up to the Open Humans platform, instructions on how to connect your existing Open Humans account — or create a new one and connect this — are provided on the <a href="https://open-diabetes.eu/en/open-survey/" target="_blank">OPEN website</a>.</p>  
<p>Lastly, if your child is of adolescent age (13-17 years old), and they would like to complete a shorter version of the survey about their quality of life, you will also be able to provide them with a <b>participation link</b>. This would help enhance our understanding of the impact of DIYAPS on the quality of life of both you and your child.  Do not share this with anyone but your child, who should use this link to complete the questionnaire, so that your answers can be combined. It should not take them any longer than 10-15 minutes to complete and responses will be <b>confidential</b>. That means you will not be able to see your child’s responses and vice-versa. Sharing the participation link with your child is optional.</p>
<h1>How will the data be used?</h1> 
<p>The pseudonymised responses to the survey will be analysed by our team of researchers. <b>If you choose to upload your child’s device data to the Open Humans project, we will combine them with your responses to the survey described above to create a more complete picture of the impact of DIYAPS on the lives of people with diabetes</b>. It will also help us to (anonymously) stay “in touch” and inform you about any follow-up studies in the future.</p>
<p>Once the OPEN project is completed your anonymised data will be available to researchers upon request. To protect your privacy, any information that might lead to your identity will be removed from your data set before being accessed by any researchers.</p>
<p>The organisations in the OPEN consortium involved in accessing your data will include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>University College Dublin, Ireland</li>
    <li>Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Dedoc Labs GmbH, Germany</li>
    <li>Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Denmark</li>
    <li>Copenhagen University, Denmark</li>
    <li>The Australian Centre for Behavioural Research in Diabetes (ACBRD), Australia</li>
</ul>
<h1>How will you protect our privacy?</h1>
<p>The design of this study is in line with all EU (GDPR), Irish (Data Protection Act, 2018), and UCD (UCD ethics Committee) ethical and data protection regulations. All personal information will be made unidentifiable before being transmitted and stored in the OPEN Humans server. Every precaution will be taken to respect your privacy, in line with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).</p> 
<p>As stated above, any information that you share that may potentially inadvertently make you identifiable will be removed - this process is called pseudonymisation.</p>  
<p>Please note that only adults (aged 18+) who are able to provide consent are allowed to participate. Your child (<b>if</b> 13-17 years of age) will be asked to sign in the assent form before completing their version of the survey.</p> 
<h1>What are the benefits of taking part in this research study?</h1>
<p>There are no direct, material benefits expected from taking part in this study. However, you will be helping to improve the overall scientific knowledge about DIYAPS and its use. As a consequence, your participation and experience may help the diabetes community.</p> 
<h1>What are the risks of taking part in this research study?</h1>
<p>There are no anticipated risks expected from taking part in this study. The only discomfort you may have is related to the time you have to dedicate to complete the survey. The questionnaires that have been selected for use have been tried and tested among a large population of parents/carers of a child with diabetes and have been designed to minimize the risk of causing upset and distress. The questionnaires selected for your child are age-appropriate and tested among a large population of teenagers with diabetes. However, if you or your child do experience this or any other aspect of the study as distressing, you are free to stop participating at any time, without personal consequence, we recommend contacting your GP/primary care physician or local diabetes organizations who may be able to provide you with psychological and practical support. In addition, you may also find the following webpages helpful:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://acbrd.org.au/diabetes-and-emotional-health-factsheets/" target="_blank">Diabetes and emotional health factsheets</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.jdrf.org/t1d-resources/living-with-t1d/mental-health/" target="_blank">Mental Health</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to provide detailed personal information in a free text field, there is a small chance that you may identify yourself within the questionnaire to OPEN researchers. However, this information will be removed before the data set is shared with the rest of the OPEN research team.</p>
<h1>Can I or my child change our minds at any stage and withdraw from the study?</h1>
<p>Yes! If you and your child decide to participate and subsequently change your mind, you may withdraw from the study at any time. You may also choose to remove your data from future analyses of the OPEN project. To do so, please contact our research team through the details provided below. You can also have the option to leave the OPEN project on Open Humans at any time and remove any data that you have uploaded to the platform. Please note that in both instances we can only delete your data if you provide your Participant ID from the survey.</p>
<h1>How will I find out what happens with this project?</h1>
<p>The OPEN team would like you to engage with this project as much as possible. That is why we have developed a website for the OPEN project. On <a href="https://open-diabetes.eu">this website</a>, we provide regular updates on the findings of our project and you may also sign up to our newsletter to receive regular email updates.
